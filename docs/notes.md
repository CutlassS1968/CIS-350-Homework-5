##Requirements
* Two views, one for <ins>**product listing**</ins> and one for <ins>**detailed product information**</ins>

* There should be *at least* <ins>**three products on display**</ins>, where each product has some basic information (title, description, price, etc.).

* You should be able to click a product on the <ins>**product listing view**</ins> and bring up detailed information in the <ins>**detailed product information view**</ins>.

* There needs to be a <ins>**clear separation of responsibilities**</ins>, as required by the MVC pattern.

##Deliverables
1. A **class diagram** demonstrating the classes participating within your MVC implementation. Clearly define responsibilities, attributes, methods, associations, multiplicities, etc.
2. **Well-commented code** that solves **THE PROBLEM** above. Each file should be clearly commented and its purpose exceedingly clear. Your code should be **runnable** by me as well.
3. **Instructions for running your code**. Clearly describe how I can run your code, what language/modules it relies on, etc. For instance, fi you made a Java Swing application, describe the version of Java you used, what your main class is to be executed, and the dependency on Swing. Basically assume my PC is a blank slate that needs everything you have to get it running.
4. **Screenshots of you running your application and demonstrating each view**. I want to see your process for interacting with the application so that I can replicate it.
